> Design RESTful APIs with best practices

## Prompt

```
Help me design a REST API for [FEATURE]. Include:

## Endpoints
- List all endpoints with HTTP methods
- Use RESTful naming conventions
- Include query parameters for filtering/pagination

## Request/Response
- JSON schemas for request bodies
- Response formats with proper status codes
- Error response structure

## Authentication
- Recommend auth strategy (JWT, API keys, OAuth)
- Protected vs public endpoints

## Database
- Suggested table schema
- Indexes for common queries
- Relationships between entities

## Edge Cases
- Rate limiting approach
- Validation rules
- Idempotency for mutations

Format as OpenAPI-style documentation.
```
